# Chip Sales Analytics

This is my first data analysis project focusing on retail analytics which was done under Quantium Virtual Experience Program.
All datasets used here are provided by Quantium.

## Contents
- [Data Preparation and Customer Analytics](https://github.com/olivertan1999/chip_sales_analytics/blob/master/Transaction%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
<br/> This part involves performing high level data checks and analysing the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviour. In addition, we derive extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data and define metrics of interest to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment.
- [Experimentation and Uplift Testing](https://github.com/olivertan1999/chip_sales_analytics/blob/master/Experimentation%20and%20uplift%20testing.ipynb)
<br/> Here, we extend our analysis from the previous section to identify benchmark stores (control stores) that allow us to test the impact of the trial store's new layouts on customer sales on the chip category.
